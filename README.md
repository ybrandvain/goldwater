A collection of successful research statements for Goldwater foundation applications in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.


## Spreadsheet
For ease of browsing I will place all of these proposals on a googledoc like the one I compiled for GRFPs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ex9ykvReOQQSzMjEo9ur89BA_SfRBat4UrEDeiPw2A/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)

## Contributing

Please email or submit a pull request if you would like to add your statements to this repo. Please send files as pdf, with as much information as you are comfortable including in the title, such as <last name>_<year>_<institution>_<outcome>.pdf. This is a blatant rip-off of Jeff Ross-Ibarra's repo for job materials [link](https://github.com/RILAB/statements)
